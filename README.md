# Econometrics_Research
Looking at the relationship between educational attainment and income per capita 

Research paper was for ECMT 463 class. I decided to redo the data manipulation and cleanup using Python. 

All the code is in Research.py file. For slightly more detailed info with a table or two, check out Research.ipynb. Regression statistics can be found in regression.xlsx and all the csv files contain the data I used for this project.
